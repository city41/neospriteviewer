# Neo Geo Sprite Viewer

A website that lets you view a Neo Geo game's sprite tiles. You can view both C ROM sprite tiles and S ROM fix tiles.

It also supports CD game .spr and .fix files, which are their version of C and S ROM files.

It does this by loading the Tile ROM data and extracting out the graphics.
